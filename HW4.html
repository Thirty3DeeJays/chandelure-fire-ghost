										<p>For a topic that people disagree on, create 2 visualizations that show 2 different results.</p>
									</header>

									<p>Data is an important tool that helps us decide big things. A visualization that is good will
									get you the information you want as well as teach you what you want to know. However, people know
									this and may intentionally keep some data away from the viewer in order for a potentially
									malicious point to be given across to the viewer. For example, COVID cases were a hotly debated
									topic recently and many people used either uninformed or malicious graphs and charts in order to get
									intentionally bad points to come across as good point to people who they were debating with. However, COVID talks
									are boring to me, and I want to talk about something that matters to me more. For me, that's who the GOAT
									is.</p>

									<p>Now, in the NBA, there are many different opinions on who the "GOAT" (Greatest of all Time) is. However, what it
									gets down to for most people is the two men pictured above: Lebron James or Michael Jordan. Both are incredible basketball
									players with immense amounts of talent. Both have reasons for why one should be considered better than the other. However, many people
									try to use poorly made graphics as a quick "gotcha!" moment, when, in reality, both players had some peaks and falls in their career.</p>

									<p>Phasellus odio risus, faucibus et viverra vitae, eleifend ac purus. Praesent mattis, enim
									quis hendrerit porttitor, sapien tortor viverra magna, sit amet rhoncus nisl lacus nec arcu.
									Suspendisse laoreet metus ut metus imperdiet interdum aliquam justo tincidunt. Mauris dolor urna,
									fringilla vel malesuada ac, dignissim eu mi. Praesent mollis massa ac nulla pretium pretium.
									Maecenas tortor mauris, consectetur pellentesque dapibus eget, tincidunt vitae arcu.
									Vestibulum purus augue, tincidunt sit amet iaculis id, porta eu purus.</p>
