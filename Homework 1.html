					<h1>Assignment 1</h1>
					<p><em>For this assignment, we were tasked with finding a data set and creating 3 data visualizations with it</em></p>
					<p>This dataset provides data for all 1025 Pokemon and their different forms. Some of
					the Pokemon get forms that either increase or decrease one of their stats. The first chart
					provides insight into a Pokemon's BST, which is a Pokemon's HP (health points), Attack, Defense, Special
					Attack, Special Defense, and Speed.</p>
				<h2>The Bar Chart</h2>
				<span class="image main">
					<img src="BSTtypes1.PNG" alt
						width="700"
						height="700">
				</span>
					<p>The bar chart shows the highest and lowest BST for each type. The data also shows a NONE option and that
					is because there are Pokemon who do not have a secondary type. However, the chart doesn't really give us much to
					work with. If anyone is to take something away from this, its that Dragon and Poison have a Pokemon with a 
					really high BST. </p>
					<h2>The Ridgline Plot</h2>
					<span class="image main">
						<img src="BSTtypes2_.PNG" alt
							width="700"
							height="700">
					</span>
					<p>The ridgeline plot shows a better distribution of values. Showing that some types like Bug and Normal have a higher
					density towards the lower end of the BST spectrum and thus, may not be as good as a Dragon or Steel type. Also, I have
					added color that each type is represented by in the game. However, what this is best at showing us is the average Pokemon
					ends up at around 500 BST when fully evolved.</p>
					<h2>The Boxplot</h2>
					<span class= "image main">
						<img src="Boxplot_BST.PNG" alt
							width="700"
							height="700">
					</span>
					<p>The Boxplot is near perfect, providing a look at the echelons of each type and their BST, while conveying it very
					clearly to the reader,and yet it could be better. It doesn't show the density of the BST's. However, we have one more
					chart that combines the density idea of the ridgeplot and the look of the box plot.</p>
					<h2>The Violin Plot</h2>
					<span class= "image main">
						<img src="ViolinPlot.PNG" alt
							width="700"
							height="700">
					</span>
					<p>The Violin Plot is a perfect combination of the two previous plots. It shows density of the BST's like the ridge plot while keeping the
					style of a box plot. This also has all the points in each of the types with the jitter plot. The jitter plot is just to show where the points
					are at, and I tried to make the points interactive, R was giving me a difficult time, so i decided to just use the points on their own.</p>
					<h2>Conclusion</h2>
					<p>I believe all the plots have their own strengths and weaknesses, and while they may not all be perfect, each plot has their own uniqueness
					that can make or break a data visualization</p>
