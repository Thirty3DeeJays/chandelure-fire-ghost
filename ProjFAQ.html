											<h3>What is VALORANT?</h3>
											<p>VALORANT (or Val, for short) is a 5v5 tactical shooter made by the game developer, Riot Games. 
											Think <em>Counter Strike</em> meets <em>Overwatch 2</em>. Despite Val only coming out 4 years ago,
											it is already incredibly popular, with fans around the world following the game and playing it. VALORANT,
											being developed by Riot games, already has a huge E-Sports scene, as the fact
											that League of Legends is the most popular E-Sport in the world and is also developed by Riot Games. 
											In fact, the latest event, Masters Shanghai,
											had over 900,000 peak viewers during the Grand Finals. Even with the fact that the matches were taking
											place at 4 am and 7 am eastern time! The point of all this is that Riot knows what they're doing when it
											comes to E-Sports, and I like it. I am personally a big fan of the game and the E-Sport itself (go G2).</p>

											<h3>What is the project about?</h3>
											<p>For my project, I would like to take a look at some of the personalities that have played or are still
											playing the E-Sport of Valorant. I want to take a statistical deep dive into the numbers of some of these
											players, to see what kept them at the top, or what made them fall to the ground. There is a German word, "Sonder",
											and it is the idea that a random passerby on the street has as strange and complex of a life as your own. While
											these players certainly aren't "passerbys", they each have a story, and I want to take a look at that story through
											the lens of Statistical and Data anaylsis.</p>
											<h3>What I'm doing, data wise?</h3>
											<p>Using data gathered from <a href="https://www.vlr.gg/">vlr.gg</a> by Kaggle user Ryan Luong, I took a look at
											9 different players from different regions to tell their stories. Those 9 players are listed under the "Project" tab.</p>
