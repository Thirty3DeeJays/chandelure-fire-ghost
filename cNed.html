												<h2>Cryocells</h2>
												<p>Professional Valorant's Most Improved* Player</p>
											</header>

											

											<p>When I say Improved* with an asterisk, I don't mean that he was bad before. Far from it, actually. Cryocells (Cryo, for short) is
											incredibly mechanically gifted. I'd say probably the most mechanically sound player on this list. He was just in a bad spot at one
											point, but his team helped him with that. Matthew "Cryocells" Panganiban is an American player who is currently 
											playing for 100 Thieves.</p>

											<h3>Cryocells on SoaR</h3>
											<p>Cryo started his career on a team called Big Frames. Basically, a team that talent got poached from. Eventually, after a brief stint with Cosmic Divide,
											Cryo found himself on SoaR. He played pretty well on SoaR, amassing a KDR of 1.32 with them and a KPR of .86. But eventually, Cryocells was poached by a bigger fish.</p>

											<h3>Cyrocells on XSET</h3>
											<p>Cryocells was signed by XSET on the last day of 2021, and what an upgrade this was. XSET was a much better team, where Cryocells was able to truly shine in the Chamber meta.
											He, like many other duelist players, was forced to pick up Chamber. He played well, however, having a well above average ACS of 254.0 for the whole year on XSET. Again, Cryocells
											is good at the game. XSET, however, did not recieve a spot in Franchising. This means Cryocells would be picked up by another organization, and this is the big one.</p>

											<h3>Cryocells on 100 Thieves (Year 1)</h3>
											<p>100 Thieves decided to pick up the then 19-year old, Cryocells. But this is where the trouble starts for our hero. Cryocells had a bit of an off year. He wasn't terrible
											by any stretch of the imagination, but he was a duelist in 2023, coming off the nerfed Chamber. He just couldn't adjust to it. 100 Thieves did not qualify for any international events,
											aside from LOCK-IN at the beginning of the year, where they got 5th-8th. Something just didn't feel right for 100 Thieves and Cryo. Luckily, someone around the corner was here to help.</p>

											<h3>Cryocells in 2024</h3>
											<p>100 Thieves was able to snag Boostio, the IGL from Evil Geniuses, after they won Champs 2023 (don't ask why the team disbanded, it's a long story I don't fully understand).
											This, combined with the idea of giving Cryocells less pressure by putting him on controller more often and less on duelist, made Cryo the perfect killing machine. While his teammates would
											run into the bomb site and distract the enemies, Cryo, with his naturally good aim, would be in the back and able to pick off the enemies since they aren't looking at him. It makes you wonder why more
											teams wouldn't do this? Obviously, I'm joking, but it worked well enought to get 100 Thieves to be the Americas Stage 1 Winners.</p>

											<h3>So, why the asterisk?</h3>
											<p>Cryo was never bad. He had a down year due to a team that wasn't able to fully utilize his skill set. Boostio came in and fixed that. Cryocells did improve, but there's an asterisk because we all knew
											he was in there. He is the Most Improved* Player.</p>
