												<h2>f0rsaken</h2>
												<p>Valorant's Ultimate Flex Player</p>
											</header>
											<p>I wanted to get some more players to do that would be interesting. F0rsaken was a player that came up constantly
											 when I posed this question on Reddit of who would be interesting to do. Jason "f0rsakeN" Susanto is an Indonesian 
											player who is currently playing as an in-game leader for Paper Rex.</p>

											<h3>The True King of Valorant</h3>
											<p>F0rsaken is such an interesting player. He has the most kills of anyone covered in this project, amassing a total kill
											count since May 2024 of 5686. Most players barely eclipse the 4000's in 2 years of playing. F0rsaken also has a very interesting.</p>
											
											<h3>Paper Rex</h3>
											<p>Paper Rex, (aside from having one of the coolest names in all of ESports) is an ESports organization based out of Singapore. This means
											that we are covering our first non-North American player. While I am not the most knowledgable on APAC (Pacific) and EMEA (European) Valorant,
											I will certainly try my best. Anyway, back to Paper Rex. Paper Rex have been in Valorant for a long time. They got into Valorant in 2020, when
											the game released and have been the top dogs of APAC for a while. F0rsaken has only ever been on Paper Rex, meaning theres no changes to his team.</p>

											<h3>Cursed?</h3>
											<p>Unfortunately, for Paper Rex, while being the top dogs of the APAC region and near the top in the world in most people's eyes, they
											seem to never be able to finish the job. For every international tournament they have made, they have never won a single one. They have placed second
											or lower every time. It has almost become a meme at this point. The players are fantastic, but they can't seem to close it out.</p>

											<h3>More on f0rsaken</h3>
											<p>During all this, f0rsaken has been moved around to different roles. At first, he was their duelist in 2021 and 2022, mainly
											playing Jett and Raze. When Chamber came out, they moved him to that agent because that's what everyone else was doing and it still worked. However
											things started to take a turn in 2023, when Paper Rex finished poorly at LOCK-IN. After another dominant APAC showing, Paper Rex proceeded to take home the 
											bronze at Master's Tokyo. Another disappointing performance, and f0rsaken's play was faltering.</p>

											<h3>Role Swap</h3>
											<p>F0rsaken is the In-Game leader (IGL) for Paper Rex, meaning that during the game, he is calling the shots and making the strats with the coaches. The players
											and coaches cannot talk during a match unless there is a timeout, so an IGL's job is to call strats, and keep everyone cool under pressure. So f0rsaken took it
											upon himself to switch it up. He gave the duelist "role" to his teammates 'something' (yes, that is a player), and Jingg, and took to learning the flex position. The flex
											is exactly what it sounds like. Whatever the team needs, he will play a character that fits that role. This is partially why f0rsaken has the highest agent
											pool out of anyone in the game. I am only showing you the top 3 from each year in terms of rounds played, but f0rsaken has 18 different agents with at least one
											game played on them. There are 24 characters in the game as of June 2024. F0rsaken has played 75% of the cast, and this is all thanks to the fact that he switched to
											the flex role. His specialties, as you can see are Harbor and Kayo, both of which are great characters to support as. One downside of cutting off characters at top 3
											is that you don't get to see his other characters. He has a nasty Breach, that has shot up to the top 3 during the making of this project. Currently, f0rsaken is Valorant's
											Ultimate flex player.</p>
