												<h2>valyn</h2>
												<p>Professional Valorant's Captain of the Team</p>
											</header>
											<p>When looking at players to do for this project, I wanted to do a player from my favorite team, G2. After looking through the
											stats of all the players on the roster, I figured valyn was the best person to do this on. This is also a story about G2's core.
											Jacob "valyn" Batio is an American player who is currently playing as an in-game leader for G2 Esports.</p>

											<h3>Before G2/The Guard</h3>
											<p>Before we talk about where valyn is today, we have to talk about where he was before. In 2020, valyn joined Flow state where he played almost no
											matches and would eventually leave and join Complexity Gamingin 2021. This is where valyn would meet JonahP. After a short stint with Complexity, valyn
											would leave and get picked up by The Guard. In December of 2021, JonahP also signed with the Guard and in early 2022, trent was also signed with The Guard.</p>
											
											<h3>This is my castle</h3>
											<p>The Guard would go on to have a decent amount of success in tier 1 Valorant. They made Masters Reykjav√≠k in 2022, where they would place 7th-8th out of 12.
											But this core was unbreakable. Valyn, JonahP, and trent were all inseperable. There were 2 other players on the team, Sayaplayer and neT, who would eventually move
											on later down in their careers, but this core of 3 was inseperable. But, like other teams such as Optic, The Guard were rumored to not be getting a spot in franchising in the 2023 season.</p>

											<h3>The Decision</h3>
											<p>The players had a choice. They could sign with new teams, breaking this core and going their seperate ways. Or, they could tough it out and
											play through the gauntlet of Tier 2 Val. During this period of uncertainty, many of the players got offers from teams. Valyn, the team's leader and IGL sat down in a room with JonahP, trent, and neT and asked if they wanted to
											separate or play in Tier 2. The choice was obvious to them. They had to stick together.</p>

											<h3>Tier 2 Valorant</h3>
											<p>You may have noticed that there is no stats for 2023 for valyn. This is because the data set I got does not have tier 2 Valorant on it. But what I can say is that
											valyn continued to play well. He was the teams controller, so he made his own pathways with his smokes and abilities. Valyn made it his goal to make it back to tier 1
											no matter what. And they did it! They won the acension tournament that allowed them to become a tier 1 team! Unfortunately, The Guard as an organization, was going under.</p>

											<h3>Unfortunate news.</h3>
											<p>On August 29th, 2023, Riot Games announced that The Guard would not be able to participate in Tier 1 Valorant, due to The Guard failing to meet the deadline to agree to
											the Team Participation Agreement for VCT Americas. This caused massive uproar in the community. Many were outraged for the players, who couldn't say anything because they were
											still under contract and probably had no idea what was happening. On September 1st, The Guard released all their players and Riot told the players to find a suitable candidate to
											use for the ascension slot.</p>

											<h3>G2 Esports</h3>
											<p>3 weeks later, they found a home. G2 Esports, traditionally a European organization, picked up the players. They had actually had a spot with franchising in 2022, but lost it due to
											some controversy. G2 would go on to qualify for Masters Shanghai, all lead by their IGL valyn. If this story tells you anything, it's that valyn is a resilient and reliable dude. He was the
											IGL throughout all of this, so he is still keeping up with the meta and making sure that his players are happy, while still not knowing if he was going to be with them. He is the ultimate
											Captian of the team.</p>
