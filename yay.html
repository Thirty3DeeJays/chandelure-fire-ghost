												<h2>yay</h2>
												<p>Valorant's Fallen Angel</p>
											</header>
											<p>When first coming up with the idea for this project, the number one player I wanted to make this on was yay,
											as I believe him to have one of the most interesting stories in Valorant's history. Jaccob "yay" Whiteaker is an American
												player who is currently playing for Bleed Esports.</p>

											<h3>Yay on Duelist</h3>
											<p>Like TenZ, yay also played duelist in 2021, his main character being Jett. He played decently, but wasn't at the
											top of the game. He played for Andbox and Team Envy. He ended the 2021 season with Envy, who merged with Optic Gaming
											in 2022. But something else happened at the end of 2021 that would change the trajectory of Valorant and Valorant
											E-Sports forever.</p>
											
											<h3>Chamber</h3>
											<p>On November 16th, 2021, Riot Games released the agent Chamber. At first glance, he doesn't look like too much
											or a threat. He is a sentinel, who's job is normally to lockdown sites on defense and keep tools for watching flank on
											offense. But then, you get deeper. Chamber had an ability that allowed him to teleport between two points that
											the player chose with a very short cooldown. The radius for these teleport points were massive, essentially letting
											Chamber play less like a sentinel, and more like a duelist with sentinel abilities. Chamber's kit also allowed
											him to watch flank and help lock down sites, by the way. With 2 gadgets that would shoot a slow field and notify the
											chamber player if the gadget was activated or destroyed, Chamber could cover most of the map. This, plus the fact he got a
											desert eagle as a 3rd gun as part of his kit, and his ultimate ability was a faster sniper rifle, Chamber quickly rose to the
											top of Valorant's meta and became the most popular agent.</p>

											<h3>Yay on Chamber</h3>
											<p>Riot Games decided not to nerf Chamber during the 2022 Valorant season, and this allowed teams to have a dedicated Chamber
											player for their teams. Yay was the best. Having one of, if not the highest amount of kills and rounds on the agent, taking
											Optic gaming all the way to the Grand Finals of the 2022 season. Yay had a great supporting cast, of course, but he truly was the
											star of the show. Unfortunately, Optic ran into their rivals, LOUD, in Grand Finals, where LOUD bested them, 3-1 in a best of 5 series.</p>

											<h3>The Nerf + Franchising</h3>
											<p>During the 2022 season, rumblings were being made about the status of VCT. Many rumors came out that Riot would be starting a partnership
											series where only 10 teams from each region (North America, EMEA, and Pacific) would get a spot to playin VCT. Another rumor was that 
											Optic would not be getting a spot in franchising. These turned out to be true, as Riot announced that the 2023 season would be played under 
											the partnership era. Another thing going around Riot headquarters was the idea of a nerf (deliberately making a
											character in a video game worse for balancing reasons) to Chamber. Riot did indeed end up nerfing Chamber, perhaps too hard as he was a shell
											of his former self. His teleport radius was basically zero, his sniper rifle took way too long to shoot, he lost one of his gadgets that slowed
											enemies down. Everything that made Chamber good was gone.</p>

											<h3>Leaving his team</h3>
											<p>The players on Optic were picked up by other teams, since obviously, they were good enough to still play. However, 3 members of Optic
											were signed by NRG. Yay was not one of those members. Yay was picked up by Cloud 9 for the 2023 season. However, the Chmaber nerf
											went through, and it changed yay in a strange way. For some reason, he was a shell of his former self. During the LOCK-IN event in 2023,
											C9 got canned in round 2 of the tournament and yay was suprisingly let go. Yay would go on to play in tier 2 for a bit (I do not
											have tier 2 data) before he essentially quit Valorant professionally for the rest of the 2023 season. He would do twitch streams occasionally,
											but he seemed to be calling it quits.</p>

											<h3>BLEED Esports</h3>
											<p>In 2023, yay signed with Bleed Esports, the team he currently plays for. While he isn't on top of the world like he was in 2022, he's a decent player.
											Definitely not the star of the show anymore, but a solid role player who can do what he's asked. But a lot of people still remember his 2022 run fondly. 
											Now, he's just Valorant's fallen angel.</p>
